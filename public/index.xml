      <description>Mastodon is an open-source microblogging platform created by Eugen Rochko in 2016 - It has features that are similar to Twitter which are provided to users through independently managed &amp;ldquo;nodes&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;instances&amp;rdquo;. Every account/user on Mastodon will belong to an individual instance rather than one &amp;ldquo;central&amp;rdquo; authority unlike Twitter. Instances can be run by any individual, group or organization &amp;amp; will feature their own terms of service, code of conduct &amp;amp; moderation teams.</description>

      <description>Mastodon &amp;amp; Twitter accomplish short-form microblogging in very different ways - The end result might &amp;ldquo;look&amp;rdquo; similar but there are some important differences that we should dive into
For Profit vs Community Funded Twitter is a for-profit entity for what has historically been an entirely free-to-use, advertisement supported platform. This has meant that the product of the platform is the end-users themselves (through serving advertisements &amp;amp; selling data) - Mastodon on the other hand has no advertisements &amp;amp; you have more control over your data.</description>
