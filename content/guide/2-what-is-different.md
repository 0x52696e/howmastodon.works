Mastodon & Twitter accomplish short-form microblogging in very different ways - The end result might "look" similar but there are some important differences that we should dive into

### For Profit vs Community Funded

Twitter is a for-profit entity for what has historically been an entirely free-to-use, advertisement supported platform. This has meant that the product of the platform is the end-users themselves (through serving advertisements & selling data) - Mastodon on the other hand has no advertisements & you have more control over your data. In the past this has meant that Twitter could have large engineering teams to maintain stability & to develop new features - Mastodon typically runs off volunteer admins & moderators who might take donations to offset server hosting & administration time. Where Twitter historically had 1000's of engineers working on the platform, Mastodon instances could have a single admin or just a small collection of people who work on it.

This gulf in resources between Mastodon instances & Twitter typically doesn't matter - Mastodon instances do serve only a small % of Mastodon's total users after all, however, should there be technical problems (which, happen to **all** platforms) - please do keep in mind that difference in resources, adjust your expectations & remember the administrators that are not paid Twitter engineer salaries for keeping your experience prestine.

### Central Moderation vs Community Moderation

Twitter has central moderation - They have the final say over what content belongs on their platform & the actions that they take with the content on the platform. Twitter can unilaterally decide to ban accounts, delete posts or otherwise moderate content that they deem inappropriate. Mastodon's moderation is instance-level. We will dive into moderation on Mastodon in more detail later but in short - All Mastodon moderation happens locally on that particular instance. A moderator on one instance cannot delete accounts of users on other instances, however, they can "silence" those accounts or "suspend" them from the view of their own instance.

Instance moderators also have the ability to do "instance wide" moderation actions as desired. Some instances publish "blacklists" of instances that they have taken action against. There is no central authority who can unilaterally remove users or instances from the fediverse. Typically, action against an entire instance is only taken for egregious violations that the instance moderators are unwilling to fix themselves. As an example, if an instance was home to a high proportion of users who target & attack people of a particular minority group, other instances could take action & protect their users if the instance moderators don't action it, or, are complict in those actions themselves.
