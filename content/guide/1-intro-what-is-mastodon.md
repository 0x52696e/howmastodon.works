Mastodon is an open-source microblogging platform created by Eugen Rochko in 2016 - It has features that are similar to Twitter which are provided to users through independently managed "nodes" or "instances". Every account/user on Mastodon will belong to an individual instance rather than one "central" authority unlike Twitter. Instances can be run by any individual, group or organization & will feature their own terms of service, code of conduct & moderation teams.

Because Mastodon is decentralized, this means that no single entity can have control over the platform. Users from different instances still maintain the ability to interact with one another - This is thanks to the **fediverse** or **federated universe**. Mastodon instances stand independently each other but are interconnected in that they can all communicate with each other because all servers follow the same standards.
