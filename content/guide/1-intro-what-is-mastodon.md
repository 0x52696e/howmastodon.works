title: "What is Mastodon?"
draft: false

Mastodon is an open-source microblogging platform created by Eugen Rochko in 2016 - It has features that are similar to Twitter which are provided to users through independently managed "nodes" or "instances". Users on Mastodon belong to a specific instance.

Instances are run by different organizations/users & will feature their own terms of service, code of conduct & moderation teams. Instances can be broad & all encompassing such as the original https://mastodon.social instance - Or you can have instances that are a focussed to a particular community/social circle/language and more - Such as the instance that I have my account on https://tech.lgbt.

Instance moderators have the ability to block other instances as they wish, typically these lists are made public but it varies on the individual instance policies. This matters as it means that whilst there is no central authority who can unilaterally remove instances, there is the ability to "blacklist" instances that do not align with another instances moderation policies. Typically, most instances will block only for egregious violations that are not dealt with by the instances moderators. As an example, if an instance was home to a high proportion of users who target & attack people of a particular minority group, other instances could take action & protect their users if the instance moderators don't action it, or, are complict in those actions themselves.

The decentralized nature of Mastodon means that no single entity can have unilateral control over the platform. All of these instances have the ability to communicate with one another - That's where the term "fediverse" or "federated universe" comes from! All instances use the same methods and tools to speak with one another so that different people on different instances can communitate, interact and engage with one another. Mastodon instances stand alone from one another but have a framework of how to communicate and interact with each other.

So, in summary:

- Mastodon is an open-source platform that works by having individual "instances"
- Instances are independently managed & can be set-up by anyone
  - These instances can have their own terms, content policies & moderation proceedures
  - Instances could be setup for those with particular hobbies, language requirements or social preferences
  - Instances can maintain a blocklist
